How this works:

If you go to the '/' route, you encounter a cow that says hi!
    e.g. '/'
If you would like to know what the cow thinks about, try other routes.
    e.g. '/grass'
If you want the cow to say things about itself, use query strings
    e.g. '/?cute=true'
You can use paths and query strings together

Get philosophical with the cow and use a path that the cow won't like.
    e.g. '/hamburger'

Send using POST method. 
    Object sent must include and "id" property.
