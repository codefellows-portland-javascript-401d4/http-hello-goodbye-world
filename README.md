### Instructions

v.1.0.0 server that gives a basic response to different url requests

-To run this server, you can run "npm run test" or nodemon server.js

-To see the different responses to the http request, you must use a different url

-Base case: 'http://localhost:3000/' will respond with a welcome to the index page in the console and on the web page
-Admin: 'http://localhost:3000/admin' will respond with a 'welcome admin'
-Anything else: 'http://local:3000/<other>' by replacing <other> with any other url, it will respond back saying you requested it but that's it :(
