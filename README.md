Assignment: http-hello-goodbye-world </br>
</br>
1.) The objective of this assignment was to use the Node.js http module to create an http server that would provide 2 alternative responses, dependent upon which URL path was selected.</br>
2.) This assignment required 2 javascript files ... index.html & http.js. This assignment also incorporated the npm modules 'cowsay' and 'figlet' to add some fun to the message displayed in the terminal command line.</br>
3.) The http server is triggered via the command line, using 'node httpCowSayFiglet.js'.</br>
4.) The corresponding browser page is brought up on the local host path 'http://localhost:8080' ... with the option of augmenting the specific URL paths by adding '/halloween', '/happy_cow' or '/angry_cow'.</br>
5.) The response message that is displayed in the browser and in the command line is dependent upon which URL path is entered into the browser.
6.) Browser entry without one of the designated paths after the host will result in '404 - Not Found' error on the browser.
