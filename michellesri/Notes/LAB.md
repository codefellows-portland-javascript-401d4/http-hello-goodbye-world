======

Create an http server that responds with "hello world" or "goodbye world" depending on the Url (path).

Feel free to add a library like `cowsay` or `figlet` to enhance your response. :)

## Directions

* Use the Node.js `http` module to create an http server. 

* Your server needs to provide at least two possible responses based on Url (path)
		
* No tests are required, we will cover E2E Http testing tomorrow.

* As there are no tests, make sure to describe how to alter response based on request in `README.md` 

## Rubric

* Has Different Responses: 3pts
* Code Quality: 2pts
